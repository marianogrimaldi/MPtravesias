            "parrafo": "My name is Marcelo Puchatt, I am 53 years old, I was born in the province of Chaco and I have been living in La Falda, in the Sierras de CÃ³rdoba, Argentina for two decades. My career as a professional guide began in 2002, but my hobby It started much earlier. When I was 5 years old, my dad gave me my first motorcycle. I come from a family of motorcycle riders. My grandfather, an adventure lover, was a great role model for me. He was a rescuer in Chaco and Chief Mechanic. My father instilled in me a passion for motorcycles and cars and, today, they are my source of work. Throughout my career, I did a bit of everything: I raced trucks, quads and motorcycles. I was part of Daniel Mazzucco's team in the Dakar as a Mechanic in two years and other races.This sustained practice of navigation and the seniority to guide in the mountains, deserts, rivers, salt flats and through inhospitable places, mean that today I can transmit my knowledge to whoever decides to live with me the crossings, being able to carry them out with advice, expertise and total security. I deeply love what I do, and that passion devoted to hard work is what I intend to permeate those who know me. In each of the crossings, apart from ensuring a route of excellence, I provide permanent and authorized mechanical assistance, in the event that any vehicle fails or requires technical support. THEN I INVITE YOU TO BE PART OF THIS WONDERFUL WORLD OF QUAD CROSSING AND UTV, GUARANTEEING THEM A UNIQUE AND UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE."
